# Routers

Dedicated routers for different schemas in individual files.
I'm hand-rolling the input validation schemas for now, until I really really need a code gen tool.
Why? Because I don't want to deal with whatever tool I'd be using being outdated, or
adding extra javascript that I might not really need.
